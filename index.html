            <p>The Gotham City Police Department (GCPD) is the police department of Gotham City.</p>
            <p>The GCPD was founded in 1820 as the primary law enforcement agency of Gotham City. It apparently had a
              long
              history of police brutality and of corruption, as Sarah Essen commented that she had seen too many jaded
              old
              men
              buy their way into the post of Commissioner. However, it also had several honest and dedicated members.

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>The division that handles murders and some of the more serious non-metahuman crimes in Gotham. This is
              the division Gordon was a part of before becoming commissioner. Harvey Bullock formerly worked in this
              division. Former private investigator Jason Bard is now working on homicide cases for this division.</p>

            <p>Led by Capt. Maggie Sawyer, who previously served in Metropolis in a similar position with that city's
              police, the MCU deals with the most serious crimes, often involving supervillans or politically sensitive
              cases. This division is the focus of the comic book series Gotham Central.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>One of the precincts of the GCPD that presumably specialized in undercover operations. Commissioner James
              Gordon picked a 10-man squad to go undercover into Arkham City to investigate what is the true nature of
              the city-wide prison facility, but they ended up exposed and captured from an information leak.</p>
